Lodr is a loader for [lovr](https://lovr.org/).

# How to use

Clone or download this repo. Stick the lovr-lodr directory in your command line after the executable name.

If `lovr.exe` is the LÃ–VR command line on your system and `your-game` is your project directory, run

    lovr.exe lovr-lodr your-game

If files change in `your-game` while it is running, lodr will automatically relaunch it.
